# rusty_invaders

This is my little practice on Rust, following [CleanCut/invaders](https://github.com/cleancut/invaders).  
Just putting this out here to let everyone knows I'm interested in Rust.

Features:
- Player can control a spaceship to move left, right, up and down.
- Player can shoot to destroy invaders.
- Player loses when collide with an invader.
- Invaders invades downwards, player loses when invaders reach the bottom.
- Player wins when all invaders are defeated.

TODO:
- Show counter for defeated and remaining invanders.
- Explode animation when player's spaceship collides with the invaders.
- Drop bonus randomly when an invader is destroyed.
